# Hi, I'm Andrei 👋

MSci Computing Science student at the University of Glasgow, interested in systems programming, GPU computing, and machine learning infrastructure.

## 🔧 What I'm interested in 

- **Systems & GPU Programming** - C/C++, Rust, Vulkan, CUDA, GLSL
- **ML Infrastructure** - PyTorch pipeline optimization, distributed inference
- **Web & Backend** - Django/Flask, React, PostgreSQL, Docker
- **Game Dev** - Unity, XR/VR stuff, game engine design
- **Conversational Interfaces** - How can LLMs be used to provide users with new way of interacting with systems? 

## 📌 Featured Projects

**Model Runner** (Private) - My current Master's disseration, where I investigate ways of speeding up neural network runtimes on distributed systems. Will be made public after I receive my grade. 

**[uxn-on-gpu](https://github.com/AndreiGhita2002/uxn-on-gpu)** — GPU-based implementation of the Uxn virtual machine. My bachelor's dissertation exploring VM execution directly on GPU kernels using Vulkan and SPIR-V.

**[llm-discord-bot](https://github.com/AndreiGhita2002/llm-discord-bot)** — Discord chatbot with local LLM inference (Ollama) featuring semantic memory recall via embeddings and probabilistic user summaries.

**[XR Pirate Purgatory](https://github.com/UofG-XR-Group3-2025/xr-pirate-purgatory)** - VR escape room where you are a pirate trying to escape the afterlife. 

**[plane-game](https://github.com/AndreiGhita2002/plane-game)** — 1st place winner at the GUTS 2025 hackathon (Free to Book challenge).

**[neuro_arcade](https://github.com/nathanlogie/neuro_arcade)** — Django/React games platform built for the UofG School of Psychology.
